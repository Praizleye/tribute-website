            a brief biography of comfort faderera alake aberuagba
        </h6>

            In the vibrant city of Minna, on the 21st of April, 1959, the world welcomed a force of warmth and resilience – Late Mrs. Comfort Faderera Aberuagba. Born into the embrace of the Adewuyi family, with the indomitable spirit of Late Pa Samuel Adeniran and Mama Ebun Dorcas Adewuyi as her guiding stars.
            A chapter as a dedicated teacher unfolded at Garrison Primary School (Now Umaru Audi Primary School). The year 1982 saw her transition to the School of Nursing in Minna, sealing her fate as a registered nurse on the 24th of February, 1987, accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria.
            Her journey started in Suleja, under the care of her grandmother, where education became her first love. The corridors of the Baptist Transferred School in Minna (now Marafa Primary School) echoed with her footsteps, marking the completion of her primary education in 1974. Her thirst for knowledge led her to the Women Teachers' College in Zaria (WTC), where she forged her path from 1974 to 1980.
            The tapestry of her career unfolded further at the General Hospital, Kagara, where she served diligently as a staff nurse from the 13th of January 1988. Love then interwove its magic, and on the 25th of November, 1989, she embraced a new chapter as the cherished wife of Engr Prof. Folorunsho Aberuagba.
            Minna's General Hospital became a witness to her commitment until her premature retirement in October 1993. Undeterred, she ventured into the world of retail and wholesale, carving a niche for herself, especially in the realm of food warmers and coolers.
            Her legacy extends beyond professional boundaries – a beacon of love, she was happily married and blessed with three children. Late Mrs. Comfort Aberuagba's journey touched the lives of her aged mother, husband, siblings, nieces, nephews, and her precious children.
            As we bid farewell to this remarkable soul, may her gentle spirit rest in perfect peace, leaving behind a tapestry of memories that forever weave through the fabric of our hearts.
